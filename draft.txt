draft:
1. for train and test datasets,combine X and Y files to identify activitycodes for each row. 
/data/test/
	X_test.txt ->  
	Y_test.txt -> activitycode
/data/train/

2. combine rows for train and test datasets
	
3. get columnnames from features.txt
	note: there are duplicate records in features.txt (126 duplicates)
	transformation made:
		for each duplicate, assigned X, Y and Z factorial variables

4. based on the instruction, select only columns that has 'std' and 'mean' on names together  activitycode from "activity_labels.txt" file

5. create new tidy data with mean of each selected column on 1st tidy data
